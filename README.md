# HCJ_Assignment03_EyeSpy-

This is a game that generates 5 happy faces in the right pane and one less on
the left pane. If you click the extra happy face on the left it adds 5 more
happy faces - with one less on the right pane. If you push anywhere else but the
extra happy face the game ends and the board is cleared.\s\s
